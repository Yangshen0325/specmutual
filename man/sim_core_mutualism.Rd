\usage{
sim_core_mutualism(total_time, mutualism_pars)
}
\arguments{
\item{total_time}{Numeric. Total time for the simulation.}

\item{mutualism_pars}{List. Parameters used in the simulation.}
}
\value{
A list which contains:
  - `Mt`: A matrix representing the "false" matrix on the island, including some extinct and non-immigrated species occupying
           their original indices from the mainland.
  - `M_true_list`: A list of "true" matrices recorded at every 0.5 time steps until `total_time`.
  - `status_p`: A vector indicating whether each plant species is present on the island (1 for present, 0 for absent).
  - `status_a`: A vector indicating whether each animal species is present on the island (1 for present, 0 for absent).
  - `island_spec`: A table showing the evolutionary trajectory of species on the island, including their colonization
                   and branching details.
  - `island`: A list containing three components: `stt_table`, `clades_info_plant`, and `clades_info_animal`.
  - `evo_table`: A list with two elements: a table showing time steps from the start to `total_time`, and another
                 indicating which events have occurred; the last row corresponds to the final state of `stt_table`.
}
\description{
This internal function runs a Monte Carlo simulation to model the dynamics of mutualistic relationships
between plant and animal species on the island. The simulation tracks species interactions over time
based on defined parameters and generates an island state table reflecting species composition,
colonization events, and other relevant metrics.
The function requires a set of parameters (`mutualism_pars`) that define the initial conditions and rules
governing interactions, such as colonization rates and species dynamics. It returns a comprehensive
list containing the final state of the island, including species status, interaction matrices,
and an evolution table documenting significant events throughout the simulation.
